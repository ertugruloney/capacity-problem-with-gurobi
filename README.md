### Project description
```
Our aim in the project is to meet the demand with as little cost as possible.

For this purpose, when we buy materials above a certain quota from suppliers, a discount is applied, but 
there is a stock cost for every product that 
we cannot consume. we can also keep our stocks 
in our own warehouse and in the supplier's warehouse.
